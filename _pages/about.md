I am an undergraduate student with a strong interest in mathematics and computer systems. My current focus lies in probabilistic and statistical learning methods, specifically their applications to computer vision and robotics. Beyond standard coursework, I enjoy implementing a variety of predictive models in both C++ and Python.
